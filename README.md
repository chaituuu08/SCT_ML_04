# SCT_ML_04 – Hand Gesture Recognition Model

## 📌 Task Objective
To develop a machine learning model that can accurately identify and classify different hand gestures using image or video data. This project enables intuitive human-computer interaction and gesture-based control systems.

## 🧠 What I Did
- Used a hand gesture dataset with labeled images
- Preprocessed image data (resizing, grayscale conversion, normalization)
- Extracted features using OpenCV / MediaPipe
- Trained a classification model (e.g., SVM / CNN / KNN)
- Evaluated model performance using accuracy score and confusion matrix

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe (for hand landmark detection)
- Scikit-learn or TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📊 Output
- Successfully classified multiple hand gestures
- Visualized hand landmarks and predictions
- Achieved accuracy of ~XX% on validation data

## 📚 What I Learned
- Real-time image processing using OpenCV
- Feature extraction using MediaPipe
- Building classification models for visual data
- How machine learning models can be used in gesture-based applications
